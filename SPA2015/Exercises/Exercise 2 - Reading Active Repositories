Goal:
Distribution of number of active repositories per language.

Description:
Active repository for this task is defined as the repository that was created, has push events or pull request has been made to.
Available data are events taken from GitHub Archive. They are a list of json records.
Structure of the data can be found here: https://www.githubarchive.org/

Task is based on hour long data 3PM on 2015-01-01. 
Data can be found in a file: /Data/2015-01-01-15.json

Additional data retrieved from Google BigQuery can be found in a file: /Data/Google data.csv

Instructions:

1. Read the file line by line, convert json to the object and filter by CreateEvent, PushEvent, PullRequestEvents events.

2. Create data frame containing repository id and its url (because language information is missing for events).
Id can be found using the path: event$repo$id
Url can be found using the path: event$repo$url

3. Trim out 'https://api.github.com/repos/' from the url part.

4. Read Google BigQuery data from the file to the data frame and trim out 'https://github.com/' from the url part.

5. Combine repositories data and Google data base on the same url and fill in missing language information.

6. Count and visualise numbers of repositories per language.
